# Earthquake Prediction Model README

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based earthquake prediction model that uses machine learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of earthquakes in a specific region. This project is intended for educational and research purposes and should not be used as a real-world earthquake prediction system. Please note that earthquake prediction is a complex and challenging field, and this model is a simplified example.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the earthquake prediction model, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided example notebooks)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earthquake-prediction-model.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd earthquake-prediction-model
```

## Data

The dataset used for this model is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain earthquake data from reliable sources such as the US Geological Survey (USGS) or other earthquake monitoring organizations. The data should include information on earthquake events, including location, date, time, magnitude, and depth.

To use your own dataset, place the data file (e.g., `earthquake_data.csv`) in the `data` directory.

## Model

The earthquake prediction model uses a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of earthquakes. The model is built using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the earthquake data.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the data.
3. Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
4. Training: Training the model on historical earthquake data.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

The model in this repository is a basic example and is not suitable for real-world earthquake prediction. It is provided for educational purposes to showcase the machine learning pipeline.

## Usage

To run the provided example notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open one of the example notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to see how the model works.

Feel free to modify and expand upon the code to suit your specific needs.
